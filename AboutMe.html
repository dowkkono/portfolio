            <h3>I'm Rich a.k.a. <em>Dowkkono</em> (ダウッコノ)</h3>
            <p>I fostered an ardent love for computer technology back in the late 90's; like so many other millennial teens, I spent countless, frivolous hours navigating this vast internet space.. provided my dial-up connection to AOL was intact! From Encarta '98 world explorations and comic strip creations on Microsoft Paint to experimentation with SNES and N64 emulators, software had long become integral to my overall happiness.</p>  
            <p>Though the pursuit of a tech-related degree during college was a viable consideration, I instead opted to enter the healthcare space. Fast forward 15 years, I cultivated a satisfactory career in pharmacy services, while nurturing a cascade of soft skills, including quality assurance, attention to detail, problem solving, communication, time management, multitasking, and team collaboration.</p> 
            <p>Still, my passion for software never dissipated.. quite the opposite. In 2023, I was reinvigorated with the desire to learn about software and its unrelenting global influences. This time however, my interest extended beyond just software usage; I was further captivated by the prospect of actually <em>building</em> applications for a living. Thus commenced my enthusiastic journey into the realm of software engineering! I've since enrolled in a software engineering bachelor's degree program full time at WGU. I look forward to meticulously honing both my technical and soft skills, while demonstrating the fruits of my labor.</p>
