            <p>よろしくお願いします! I'm an aspiring full stack software engineer seeking to expand my career from prolific roots in pharmacy services to the innovative realm of computer science and information technology; I intend to garner as much experience as possible towards infrastructural software, computer science, and IT-related concepts. By supplementing my nascent knowledge with vital soft skills acquired over twenty years in the workforce, such as critical thinking, quality assurance, attention to detail, time/resource management, and multidisciplinary communication, I hope to engage robust learning opportunities that will help shape and solidify my software engineering journey.
